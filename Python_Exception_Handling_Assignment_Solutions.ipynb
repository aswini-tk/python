    "### 1) What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled languages translate the entire source code into machine code using a compiler before execution. This machine code is then run directly by the computer’s processor, which makes compiled programs generally faster and more efficient. Since errors are caught during compilation, they must be fixed before the program can run. Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Go, which are often chosen for performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages, on the other hand, are executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime, without a separate compilation step. This makes them easier to debug and more flexible, but typically slower than compiled languages because translation happens during execution. Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are popular interpreted languages, often used for scripting, rapid development, and applications where portability and ease of use matter more than raw performance."

    "### 2) What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running, so the program doesn’t crash unexpectedly. When something goes wrong (like dividing by zero, accessing a missing list index, or opening a non-existent file), Python raises an exception. By using try, except, else, and finally blocks, you can catch these exceptions and decide how your program should respond — for example, by showing a user-friendly error message, retrying an operation, or logging the error.\n",
    "\n",

This makes it lightweight and efficient for tasks that spend a lot of time waiting, such as file operations, database queries, or network communication. In Python, however, multithreading is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at the same time. As a result, multithreading is best suited for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-heavy computations.\n",

    "Multiprocessing, on the other hand, uses separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. This avoids the GIL issue and allows true parallelism, making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks like mathematical computations, data processing, or image rendering. While it provides better performance for heavy workloads by fully utilizing multiple CPU cores, it also comes with more overhead since processes do not share memory directly and require communication mechanisms such as pipes or queues."
